# German-Credit-Data-Analysis
Data analysis analyze the raw data and convert it into meaningful information so that businesses can take more effective decision on their businesses and make more profit.
Banks are making profit on the loan they gave to different applicants. But loan defaulters cause loss to their business. Giving loan is always a risky business. So, the bank takes a decision when processing a loan application. Will they give loan to this applicant or not. They consider it as a Good Risk or a Bad risk.
Good Risk are those where the applicant is high likely to pay back the loan.
Bad Risk are those where the applicant is not likely to pay back the loan.
The dataset contains 10 columns and 1000 rows. Each row denotes an applicant who applied for a loan from the bank. Each applicant is classified either as a good credit risk or as a bad credit risk according to his/her values of the 09 features or variables as Age, Sex, Job, Housing, Saving accounts, Checking account, Credit amount, Duration and Purpose. Risk is the dependent variable, and the other nine variables are independent variables.
